# Paris Metropolitan, an evolution
This page contains the different components, from original maps to python notebooks, that enabled to achieve the project 'Paris Metropolitan, an evolution' made in the context of the course 'Foundation to Digital Humanities' at the EPFL.
The goal of this project was to extract information from three old maps displaying the Metropolitan of Paris at three different years, 1908, 1915 and 1950. See more info about the project on http://fdh.epfl.ch/index.php/Paris_Metropolitan,_an_evolution
